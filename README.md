# SpaceX Falcon9 Launch Predictions

## IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate - Capstone Project

## Jupyter Notebook Collection: data collection, data wrangling, analysis & visualisations, dash application code, & machine learning modelling 

In this capstone project for *IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate*, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

We will collect data using SpaceX APIs & webscraping, wrangle the data, conduct exploratory data analysis, visualise data, create an interactive dashboard application for data visualisation using a Plotly's Dash, and finally try 4 different supervised machine learning classification models to predict Falcon 9 landing success.
